## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My favorite applications are Instagram, Messenger, and YouTube. My favorite features on each app are
 - Instagram has stories and the ability to customize the theme of each message chat you have with other users
 - Messenger supports the ability to search messages and allows you to download extra stickers to send to users
 - YouTube allows you to play videos and easily follow content creators that you are interested in by subscribing

I would like to make an app that stores short little notes about
your thoughts on the flavor profiles of different tea that you have tried. You
can fill one out after going to a tea place. These cards will have information that
the user can fill in and select, such as level of bitterness or how the tea was made.
These notes can be sorted based on time and price of the tea.


## Notes

There were no challenges in building the application.
